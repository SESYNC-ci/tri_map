# EPA Risk Screening Environmental Indicators

The map demo presented [here](dcdatageek.com/tri_map/) was generated from the 2009 Microdata given to SESYNC research Mary Collins. The grid layout was generated based on the [techincal documentation](http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/rsei/pubs/rsei_users_manual_v2.3.2.pdf). 

The map slider was built using [dc.js](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js) and the map was generated by creating a PostGIS database and building vectortiles with mapbox's [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#win64).
